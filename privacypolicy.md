## SLS: Privacy Policy

Welcome to the SLS (Logic Gate Simulator) app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Luka Beg.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how frustrating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

### Data Collected by the App
I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (settings data, language data, challenge, and sandbox saves) created by you (the user) is stored locally on your device only and can be easily erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.

The app does not transmit any data over the internet, ensuring your information remains private and secure. The only time this app needs connection to the internet is whilst downloading the app itself. After downloading and installing the app via Google Play or any other app distribution platform, internet connection is not needed ever again, except for updating the application to the latest version/build.

### Security
Using this application doesn't require any input of personal data or saving them, and the internet connection is not mandatory either, so I believe this app is very secure and can't have any hacker or device attacks or backdoors.


### Contact
If you find any security vulnerability inadvertently caused by me or have any questions regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email, and I will try to help you. I encourage you to reach out with any privacy-related concerns.

Yours sincerely,  
Luka Beg,
